Kernel density estimation via diffusion in 1d and 2d.

Provides the fast, adaptive kernel density estimator based on linear
diffusion processes for one-dimensional and two-dimensional input data
as outlined in the [2010 paper by Botev et al.][1] The reference
implementation for [1d][2] and [2d][3], in Matlab, was provided by the
paper's first author, Zdravko Botev. This is a re-implementation in
Python, with added test coverage.
